python3 main.py vuln-test --target 192.168.1.10 --test-type password --service ssh --port 22 --max-attempts 10

# Perform controlled network stress test
python3 main.py vuln-test --target 192.168.1.10 --test-type stress --port 80 --duration 30 --rate 15

# Enumerate services on common ports
python3 main.py vuln-test --target 192.168.1.10 --test-type enumerate --ports 22,80,443,3389
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Testing Module (`advanced_testing.py`) 
**Comprehensive security assessment with multiple authorization layers**

#### Advanced Capabilities:
- **Multi-Technique Vulnerability Scanning**: Combines multiple discovery methods
- **Protocol Fuzzing**: TCP flag manipulation, packet size testing, header fuzzing
- **Evasion Testing**: Tests fragmentation, decoy scanning, and timing evasion
- **Advanced OS Fingerprinting**: Detailed operating system detection
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed security assessment reports

#### Scan Types:
1. **Stealth**: Minimal footprint, evades basic detection
2. **Comprehensive**: Balanced approach with thorough testing  
3. **Aggressive**: Maximum testing coverage (use with extreme caution)

#### Authorization Process:
- Multi-step confirmation required
- Written authorization verification
- Legal responsibility acknowledgment
- Session tracking and logging

#### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Comprehensive security assessment
python3 main.py advanced-test --target 192.168.1.10 --scan-type comprehensive --report security_assessment.txt

# Stealth scan for minimal detection
python3 main.py advanced-test --target 192.168.1.10 --scan-type stealth --report stealth_scan.txt

# Aggressive testing (maximum capabilities)
python3 main.py advanced-test --target 192.168.1.10 --scan-type aggressive --report full_assessment.txt
```

## üî¨ Technical Capabilities
